#How do you play Crazy Eights?
'''
ASSUME YOU ARE DOING A TWO PLAYER GAME

Eight cards are dealt to each player (or seven in a two-player game).
The remaining cards of the deck are placed face down at the center of the table.
The top card is then turned face up to start the game.

Players discard by matching rank or suit with the top card of the discard pile,
starting with the player left of the dealer.
If a player is unable to match the rank or suit of the top card of the discard pile
and does not have an 8, they draw cards from the stockpile until they get a playable card.
When a player plays an 8, they must declare the suit that the next player is to play;
that player must then follow the named suit or play another 8.

As an example: Once 6â™£ is played the next player:

can play any of the other 6s
can play any of the clubs
can play any 8 (then must declare a suit)
can draw from the stockpile until willing and able to play one of the above
The game ends as soon as one player has emptied their hand.
